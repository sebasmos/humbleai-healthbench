VALIDATION NOTES
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Stratified random sampling (RSS) used for reproducibility
2. Five different random seeds (42-46) to assess variance
3. 200 samples per seed from HealthBench Hard (1000 total cases)
4. Same sample sets used for both Baseline and BODHI evaluations

DATA QUALITY CHECKS
-------------------
- All 5 baseline evaluations completed successfully: YES
- All 5 BODHI evaluations completed successfully: YES
- Sample counts verified (200 per evaluation): YES
- No missing data in key metrics: YES

STATISTICAL NOTES
-----------------
- Sample size: 5 seeds × 200 samples = 1000 total evaluations per model
- Inter-seed variance indicates robustness of findings
- Standard deviation provides measure of consistency

LIMITATIONS
-----------
1. Single model tested (GPT-4o-mini)
2. Single benchmark (HealthBench Hard)
3. No formal statistical significance testing (would require larger n)
